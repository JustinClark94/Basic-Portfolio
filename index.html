        <p>I currently work as an Immigration Paralegal in downtown Chicago, looking for a career change. I'm looking for a new challenge and aspire to be a Frontend Developer. I decided to take  Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp to jumpstart my career in web development. This was probably one of the best decisions I have made in my professional career. within a 6 month period, I was faced with many challenges resulting in multiple all-nighters, cups of coffee, and a few hours of sleep. There were many sacrifices I had to make while taking the class, however, it was work that I enjoyed - so the sacrifices were definitely worth it.</p>
        <p>I'm a creative at heart, so working in Frontend Development is perfect for me. I love creating website that are pleaseing to the eye, easy to use, and versitile. </p>
